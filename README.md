## About the Project

Task #03 - Payment Gateway Integration.

It is a simple donation website for an environmental non-profit organization. There is a donate button on the page which can be clicked and the user will be directed to the payment page. The user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type. An invoice will be generated and sent to the user's email if the payment is successful.

The website is created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The payment functionality is carried out with Razorpay's test mode.
